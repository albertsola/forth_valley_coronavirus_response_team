# Forth Valley Residents Volunteer Makers and Hackers Coronavirus Response

It is March 2020 and our cities are being invaded. So far humans are really unorganised and most of them are unaware that this is a war between species.

Each country is trying to fight world wide war 3 on their own without realising all of us need to fight together, or we are not going to win this battle.

Do you want to fight? Or do you want to wait for Boris Johnson and Donald Trump to solve this war?

**We're looking for warriors that want to win this war. We want to build an army and fight back!**

Forth Valley Hospital have requested 180 face masks - staff want to pay the costs but we do not think this should be the case.

## How can you help?

We would like you to get in touch if you can help us in any of our current goals:

- Put our machines to use: sewing machine, 3D printers, laser cutters, punch holes and scissors, etc.
- Find a use for spare parts and materials in our homes that we don't use
- Distribute and co-ordinate resources
- Share instruction manuals and spread the message

## Supply and Demand

## Long term plan

We would not keep it to just 3D Printing, this is the first need we had in Spain, but then it escalated to all kind of other needs from health care professionals. They run out of all kind of protective equipment, valves, respiratories, gloves, etc.
